 I can't believe it.
 It's here.
 It's time.
 Hey, what's up guys?
 My name is Ochino.
 Welcome to this announcement video because we are about to begin the game engine series.
 Yes, you heard me right.
 I can't believe how long it's been.
 I'm so excited to say this but that's it.
 The game engine series is ready and it's about to start coming out starting next week.
 That's it.
 I'll see you guys next time.
 No, I'm kidding.
 But seriously, it's like, I don't know.
 I've been planning this for like the last two years probably and I've got this massive
 plan.
 Everything's ready to go.
 I've just, I can't wait to get started on this.
 It's going to be a huge thing for the whole community.
 It's not going to be just me kind of working on this.
 It's going to be everyone.
 It's going to be really in depth, really detailed.
 There's going to be heaps of just stuff that's going to go into all of the videos.
 It's just, we're going to build something really, really amazing together and I'm so
 excited and I just can't wait to actually start this thing.
 So I'm just so happy right now.
 I can't even like, I don't know what else to say.
 In this video, we're just going to go over a little bit about what on earth the game
 engine series is for those of you who are known, for those of you who might be new to
 my channel, but that's kind of my only plan really for this series and obviously just
 to say that that's it.
 Like it's coming, it's ready, it's going to go up like anytime.
 It's just like, oh, I just can't wait.
 So those of you kind of new to my channel, you might have noticed that I kind of am,
 like this channel is kind of like a programming channel, but it's not just limited to like
 programming or game programming or anything like that.
 Actually it's really just a channel that revolves around me and my interests because I love
 teaching and I love sharing everything that I learn with everyone.
 That's always been a passion of mine and it doesn't make any sense for me to like teach
 things that I'm not interested in or things that I'm not currently doing with my life.
 I am at the moment and for the last almost four years now, I've been a game engine developer
 at EA, currently working in the Frostbite organization on the mobile engine.
 So that's my life.
 That's what I do, right?
 So I love sharing that with everyone and to be honest, like just teaching has just always
 been a huge passion of mine.
 So what this channel really is, is just me kind of talking about my passions, talking
 about stuff that interests me, whether that be kind of in vlogs or tutorial videos and
 teaching you guys kind of the same thing that I've learned or just new things that I've
 picked up or things that I'm realizing because I feel that programming and like, you know,
 game engine development or game development is like in general has just been like such
 a, like it's just been, it's been over complicated so, so, so much.
 And I feel like with the way that I teach, like in a lot of cases, because I do private
 like sessions as well, very limited, like seriously, because like I'm so busy, but I
 do have like five or so students who I do teach privately one on one.
 Just the way that everything clicks for them when I explain something, because I try and
 kind of simplify it and just be like, well, actually, you know, if you think about it,
 you know, it's not actually that difficult.
 Like I just love doing that so much.
 And that's kind of a reflection of what my channel, I guess is about.
 It's about kind of me teaching my passions and what the stuff that I'm interested in,
 in a bit of a, like in a simple way and kind of hope, hopefully in that case, helping a
 lot of you people out because that's what I love to do.
 Now what I want to say is that my passions don't lie in game programming at all.
 Like I don't like games.
 I'll say that.
 Like it's as simple as that.
 I don't, I don't play games in my spare time.
 I did kind of when I was younger, when I was like a kid, I guess.
 But like basically as soon as I become, since I became an adult, apart from the occasional
 like, you know, a game of something multiplayer with friends, like I don't, don't play games
 in my spare time at all.
 I'm just not interested in that.
 I'm not saying that like I'm against that or like games are evil or games are bad.
 Like it's a waste of time.
 Just for me personally, I get bored.
 Like it's just not, I don't, it's not something I enjoy doing really.
 So of course making games is also something that I don't necessarily enjoy doing.
 What I am really interested in and what I do enjoy a lot is making game engines.
 And I actually made a video of Log in Germany recently, which I will link up there, which
 is about, you know, games versus engines and kind of deciding what it is that you want
 to make and kind of just talking about the differences.
 It's so bright out here.
 And just talking about the differences kind of between, you know, what it's like to make
 a game versus what it's like to make an engine and all of that.
 So check out that video if you want kind of to meet me to expand a little bit more about
 what I'm talking about here, because that's not what this video is about.
 But the point is like, I don't really like games.
 I really like making games, but what I do love doing is making engines.
 And I guess this is kind of what this channel is about.
 And like, you know, the C++ and the OpenGL stuff that I've been teaching over the last
 almost two years now has kind of been specifically geared towards, right, let's take all that
 and let's actually build an engine now.
 And again, like I am going to, I am titling this the game engine series, right?
 But it's not really necessarily going to be a game engine.
 I mean, if you think about what a game engine is and what specifically I want to be building
 is it's just really like kind of a 3D real time rendering application.
 That's what it is, right?
 It's a way, it's an engine to make a 3D real time rendering application, right?
 What I want to be able to do and an interactive one at that as well, what I want to be able
 to do is make kind of this framework, this engine so that people can construct real time
 interactive 3D applications.
 That is the idea, right?
 With 3D graphics, that's the idea.
 So of course you could apply that to games.
 Absolutely.
 I mean, a lot of people will.
 It's going to be very well optimized for kind of, you know, big scenes and lots of entities
 and all that kind of stuff.
 And I'll probably throw in, you know, scripting and all of that kind of gameplay related code
 because that's not necessarily applicable to just games either, right?
 What we're going to be building is this engine that's capable of so much more than just making
 games.
 It's just capable of rendering interactive 3D graphics.
 Like that's really cool.
 So I can't wait to kind of build that with everyone.
 I'll talk a little bit about what it's going to include.
 I'm not, like we'll have an overview video where we discuss kind of the stages of this
 whole project.
 And I'll probably like write kind of on a whiteboard, not really on a whiteboard, like
 a tablet so that you guys can see.
 And we'll kind of go through everything step by step.
 I don't want to really do that now, just off the top of my head because I'm sure I'll miss
 things and I don't want to pull up notes now.
 We want to kind of sit down in the studio in the office, if you will, and actually go
 through that.
 But that being said, you know, we are going to kind of break down the project and go through
 everything step by step.
 But the idea is like we're going to kind of build this thing together.
 Now over me planning this series, and one of the reasons why it took so long was because
 it's just such a massively complicated task.
 Building an engine like this takes years for a whole team of people, right?
 Now I'm fortunate in the fact that I kind of more or less know what I'm doing because
 I do have so many years of experience of actually making kind of a game engine and being in
 a game engine team.
 So I do know how to make a game engine.
 I've never really sat down and made a full kind of engine from scratch where I would
 consider it to the point of like, that's it, we can ship applications with this engine now
 because it has every, it's fully featured, right?
 I've never actually done that in my life.
 I know how everything works and I've done it all separately in different modules, but
 to combine it all into one huge project, not something that I've really done, right?
 And that's something that I've just been wanting to do.
 So this isn't even just necessarily me being like, all right, let's make a series on how
 to make a game engine.
 This is me being like, that's it.
 I want to make a game engine now.
 I want to make my own engine.
 I want us to make our own engine, right?
 From the ground up, but unlike Sparky, which was another engine that I did make about three
 years ago, three and a half years ago, I think now.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 That, that was kind of more or less, you know, for games specifically.
 And that was very kind of like quickly put together because it was, I made it in like
 the base, the base version of it in like 40 days for, for a game programming competition.
 Like this is going to be like, and because of that, it was kind of me typing code and
 then explaining some things along the way.
 Whereas this is going to be a tutorial.
 Like this is going to take time.
 It's going to be like slow.
 It's going to be, it's going to feature me like writing stuff, drawing diagrams for you
 guys, notes, all of that kind of stuff.
 It's going to be like a full course almost.
 Right.
 It's not going to be just something that I just, you know, whip up and kind of improvise
 on.
 It's been planned.
 It's like this whole thing where I'm actually going to explain everything.
 And because of that, these videos are going to be long, not necessarily long, but there's
 going to, it's going to be very detailed and we might not get very far immediately.
 Like it's going to take a lot of time to actually build this up.
 And basically it's almost like, like this engine and I'm sure that obviously, obviously
 in my life, like, oh, probably scrap this eventually, make a new engine as technology
 continues to improve.
 And as I get, get smarter and I learn new things as well, obviously we're all, we're
 all learning new things.
 Right.
 But this is almost like just a, almost like a little life project for me.
 It's just something that I want to do in my life.
 I want to build a game engine.
 You guys are going to watch me and I'm also going to like work on it with you guys.
 And I'm also going to explain everything and teach you what I'm doing, how I'm doing,
 and we're going to decide things together.
 So it's going to be a really exciting project and I absolutely can't wait to get this thing
 started.
 It's been just, I've been wanting to do this my whole life basically, or my whole kind
 of YouTube career life.
 And it's finally happening and I'm so excited.
 Now you guys are going to come in, in the, in the, in the fact that like I am going to
 actively work with you guys.
 This is going to be a public project on GitHub.
 It's going to be completely free, of course.
 It's just going to be like up on GitHub.
 You can look through every commit.
 You can log issues.
 There'll be like issue tracking.
 We'll have like a project because it's like almost like a Trello board that you can have
 on GitHub now, GitHub project or whatever it's called.
 We're going to have that full thing set up like a professional game studio.
 I think people are coming.
 Anyway, professional games, your professional team, and it's going to be so, so, so cool.
 That's going to be completely free.
 So you guys are going to interact with that repository, potentially even get collaborators
 in to help write the code for this.
 Because again, it is going to be such a big thing.
 And because it's such a big project that does kind of require a lot of man hours, a lot
 of work, obviously I'm going to have to cut corners in some places because I can't just
 build like unity or unreal by myself while explaining all of it and documenting it on
 video.
 That's, that's, that's physically impossible.
 And I'm not trying to be realistic and be like, that's what I'm going to do.
 It's not like, for example, with the level editor and game engine tools, that's all going
 to be kind of built into the actual game runtime, like using I'm gooey because it's not something
 that I can just be like, okay, I'm going to make a full Windows application that's going
 to be a level editor with my own UI framework with that's not going to happen.
 It's impossible, right?
 Like this stuff takes so much time.
 So there have been like compromises that I've had to make in order to actually make this
 project realistic.
 And I have thought about a lot of them and yeah, I mean like it's, but it's still going
 to be amazing and I absolutely can't wait.
 And we are going to be writing a lot of things from scratch.
 We'll be using libraries obviously and other kind of third party vendor kind of supplied
 tools and like code frameworks or whatever that's going to happen.
 Hopefully the wind isn't bad.
 But overall, a lot of it is going to be written from scratch from the ground up, which is
 going to be really, really, really exciting.
 Now if you want to support this project because I do need your help, this is going to take
 a lot of my time.
 It already has.
 So if you want to see this project actually kind of come to life and more of these episodes
 to go up, I really do need your support.
 So I do have a Patreon, patreon.com/thechurno.
 You will get rewards for helping to support of course, such as early access to like game
 engine source code.
 The actual project will be on GitHub, will be public, will be free, but you'll get kind
 of code before it actually goes up.
 You'll also get experimental development branches, which is like me already having implemented
 certain features before I make the video about them.
 Like and that could be months before, right?
 So you'll kind of see me write the code as I write the code myself before I make videos
 and all that stuff.
 And you can also hang out with me on like, um, on Discord.
 We have like a video chat once a month where we all have all the kind of partner, which
 is like, there's a tier called partner.
 All of the partners kind of will kind of hang out in a video chat and we talk about stuff
 and we even, we've been talking about the game engine series for the last year.
 So those guys actually know a lot about what I'm, what I'm saying here now, which is pretty
 cool because you know, that kind of like, I think that's 20 or so partners, they know
 like everything, which is really cool.
 And we have like our own partner or in the discord chat and all of that.
 So you do get a handful of rewards, but most of all, you're just allowing me to kind of
 maybe work less and, and kind of spend more of my time developing this game engine series,
 um, because you'll kind of be supporting me financially.
 So that's just such a, such an amazing thing.
 Um, and I'm so grateful for the people who have made it realistic for me to actually
 spend so much of my time on this.
 Um, so definitely jump on that and let's see, let's see how good, how big of a game engine
 we can all build together and how good, how good we can make it.
 Absolutely.
 Can't wait.
 I will see you guys next time.
 Oh, I love all of you.
 Goodbye.
 Good bye.
 Bye!
